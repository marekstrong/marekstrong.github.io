I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, working under the supervision of [Prof Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/). Within the [Natural Language and Information Processing (NLIP)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) group, my research centers on automated fact-checking, with a particular emphasis on natural logic inference and temporal reasoning with large language models. I am also affiliated with [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) as an [enrichment student](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/enrichment-students/marek-strong).

Prior to my doctoral studies, I was an applied scientist at Amazon, were I worked on Text-to-Speech for Alexa. Before Amazon, I was a research associate at the University of Edinburgh ([ParaCrawl Project](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.417.pdf)).

I have an MPhil degree in Advanced Computer Science from Cambridge University and BSc in Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh.
